    <h1>Welcome to Our Game!</h1>
    <br><p>Welcome to twenty-one’s final project for CS308! This website serves as a user manual to navigate how to <i>interact</i> with the game and <i>extend</i> it. The buttons on the top of the screen link to information regarding various components of the gameplay. There is first the overview, which describes the capabilities and flow for user interaction. There are also links to the Lobby, Validator, and Gameplay sections, which are more specific and tied to certain functionality.</p><br>

    <p>Additionally, on the left side of the screen, you will see links to specific XML file types. One file, a LobbyView, is needed to launch a game. From there, a bundle of five files—including a Deck, Game, Hand, Players, and GameView—runs a specific card game. By explaining how to interact with our game, in addition to its underlying data, our hope is that future developers can create custom games that extend its flexibility without changing the underlying architecture. </p><br>
