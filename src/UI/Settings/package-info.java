/**
 * Package that contains all of the components needed to create a Settings Bar which can be applied to a LobbyView or GameView object.
 * Inheritance hierarchies exist within the Pickers and Icons used.
 * Consumers are employed to allow methods to apply to an entire view while giving as much separation between the Settings Bar and a class that is composed with it as possible.
