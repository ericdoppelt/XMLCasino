 * Basic utilities class that provides services that do not effect game implementation, but instead formatting of the the screen and the language of the text displayed.
 * Formatter and ScreenPosition handle UI formatting in terms of spacing, alignment, and position.
 * LanguageBundle allows multiple objects to reference the same underlying ResourceBundle.
 * CardTriplet provides an easy way to send card information from the Controller to the View.
