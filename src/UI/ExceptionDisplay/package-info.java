/**
 * Package used to display exceptions. Currently, all functionality comes from the ExceptionDisplayer class.
 * This uses JavaFX alerts to notify of exceptions thrown in a user-friendly way via means of Dialogues.
 * Extensions to this class could create custom Dialogues that are applied to the Alerts for a better looking display.
 * Alerts are stylized with CSS and text comes from exception messages and a LanguageBundle.
